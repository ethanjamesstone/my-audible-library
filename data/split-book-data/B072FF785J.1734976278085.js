Smith details his argument in five books: </p> <ul> <li>Book I. Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Power of Labour </li> <li>Book II. Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock Introduction</li> <li> Book III. Of the Different Progress of Opulence in Different Nations</li> <li> Book IV. Of Systems of Political Economy</li> <li> Book V. Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth</li> </ul> <p> Taken together, these books form a giant leap forward in the field of economics.
