window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took 18 truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day - as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?\"</p> <p>Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, <i>Built to Last</i> provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond.</p>";
