window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is not a self-help book. It’s a wake-up call!</p> <p>Can’t Hurt Me, David Goggins’ smash hit memoir, demonstrated how much untapped ability we all have but was merely an introduction to the power of the mind.

Whether you feel off-course in life, are looking to maximize your potential or drain your soul to break through your so-called glass ceiling, this is the only book you will ever need.</p> <p>An annotated edition of Never Finished, offering over three hours of bonus content featuring deeper insights and never-before-told stories shared by David. Not available in other formats.</p>";
