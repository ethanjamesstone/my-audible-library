window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What are the odds? Statistics tell us that African-American males who grow up in a single-parent household are nine times more likely to drop out of high school and 20 times more likely to end up in prison than any other demographic. But what would it take for one young man not only to rise above those statistics but also become a Navy SEAL, actor, entrepreneur, writer, and successful husband and father? </b></p> <p>In <i>Transformed</i>, Remi Adeleke takes you back to stories from his childhood, from living as Nigerian royalty to losing his father early in life and being financially stripped of everything by the Nigerian government. He delves into being raised by a single mother in the Bronx and doesn’t shy away from his illegal activities as a young man that threatened to derail his future. At every turn, including throughout his naval career, Adeleke found a way to overcome the odds, even when it didn’t make sense. His is an inspiring story of true personal transformation.</p>";
