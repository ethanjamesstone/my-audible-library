window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Robert Greene's previous best seller, <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i>, distilled 3,000 years of scheming into a guide <i>People</i> praised as \"beguiling... literate... fascinating\" and Kirkus denounced as \"an anti-<i>Book of Virtues</i>.\" </p> <p>In <i>Art of Seduction</i>, Greene returns with a new instruction audiobook on the most subtle, elusive, and effective form of power because seduction isn't really about sex. It's about manipulating other people's greatest weakness: their desire for pleasure. </p> <p>Synthesizing the work of thinkers including Freud, Diderot, Nietzsche, and Einstein, reporting the enticing strategies of characters throughout history, <i>The Art of Seduction</i> is a comprehensive guide to getting what we want any way we can. </p>";
