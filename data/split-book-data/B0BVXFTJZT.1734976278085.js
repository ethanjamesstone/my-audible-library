window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Rian Stone once called the Red Pill praxeology the Chilton Manual for intersexual dynamics. Chilton Manuals were model and make-specific handbooks that auto mechanics used to identify parts and processes to repair cars. Everything about that car, from the smallest lug nut to the biggest engine block, would be detailed in that manual. The Chilton Manual doesn’t care what you think about the car’s design, nor does it bother debating how best to repair or drive the vehicle. It only details what that car is. The Chilton Manual is a perfect praxeology.\" (Rollo Tomassi)</p> <p><i>Frame </i>is the first in a series, descripting the work of thousands of men over a decade who have learned how to create a positive male identity in a world that not only lacks it, but punishes it. This first volume describes the tetrahedron of frame, and how to use it to calm the chaos in a suboptimal life, and drive towards something better: self actualization.</p>";
