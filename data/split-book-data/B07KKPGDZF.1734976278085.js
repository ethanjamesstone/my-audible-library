window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-seller. Over five million copies sold</p> <p>For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare--poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a US Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force tactical air controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring <i>Outside </i>magazine to name him the Fittest (Real) Man in America.</p> <p>In <i>Can't Hurt Me</i>, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40 percent of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.</p> <p>An annotated edition of <i>Can't Hurt Me</i>, offering over two hours of bonus content featuring deeper insights and never-before-told stories shared by David. Not available in other formats.</p>";
