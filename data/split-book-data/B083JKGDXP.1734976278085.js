window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Drawing on his experience as a psychiatrist, business consultant, and coach, author Mark Goulston combines his background with the latest scientific research to help listeners turn the \"impossible\" and \"unreachable\" people in their lives into allies, devoted customers, loyal colleagues, and lifetime friends. <i>Just Listen </i>provides simple but powerful techniques listeners can use to really get through to people. </p> <p>You'll learn how to: make a powerful and positive first impression; listen effectively; make even a total stranger (potential client) feel understood; talk an angry or aggressive person away from an instinctual, unproductive reaction and toward a more rational mindset; and achieve buy-in - the linchpin of all persuasion, negotiation, and sales. </p> <p>Whether they're coworkers, friends, strangers, or enemies, the first make-or-break step in persuading anyone to do anything is getting them to hear you out. With this groundbreaking audiobook, listeners will be able to master the fine but critical art of effective communication.</p>";
