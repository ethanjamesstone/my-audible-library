window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ankur Warikoo is an entrepreneur and content creator whose deep, witty, and brutally honest thoughts on success and failure, money and investing, self-awareness and personal relationships have made him one of India’s top personal brands. In his first book, Ankur puts together the key ideas that have fuelled his journey—one that began with him wanting to be a space engineer and ended with him creating content that has been seen and read and heard by millions. His thoughts range from the importance of creating habits for long-term success to the foundations of money management, from embracing and accepting failure to the real truth about learning empathy. This is a book to be listened to, and repeated, a book whose lines you will take note of and think about again and again, a book you will give your family and friends and strangers. Ankur hopes for this book to become the most gifted book ever!</p>";
