window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The new question: Ten years after the worldwide best seller <i>Good to Great</i>, Jim Collins returns to ask: Why do some companies thrive in uncertainty, even chaos, and others do not? In <i>Great by Choice</i>, Collins and his colleague, Morten T. Hansen, enumerate the principles for building a truly great enterprise in unpredictable, tumultuous, and fast-moving times. </p> <p>The new study: <i>Great by Choice</i> distinguishes itself from Collins’s prior work by its focus on the type of unstable environments faced by leaders today. </p> <p>The new findings: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>The best leaders were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid. </li> <li>Following the belief that leading in a “fast world” always requires “fast decisions” and “fast action” is a good way to get killed. </li> <li>The great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>This book is classic Collins: contrarian, data-driven, and uplifting. He and Hansen show convincingly that, even in a chaotic and uncertain world, greatness happens by choice, not by chance. </p>";
