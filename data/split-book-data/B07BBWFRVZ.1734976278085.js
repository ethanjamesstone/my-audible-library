window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>What is the boy crisis?</i></p> <p><i>It's a crisis of education.</i> For the first time in American history, our sons will have less education than their dads.</p> <p><i>It's a crisis of mental health.</i> As boys become young men, their suicide rates go from equal to girls to six times that of young women.</p> <p><i>It's a crisis of sexuality.</i> Sex is a minefield for our sons. They're bombarded with mixed messages, afraid of being either too sensitive or not sensitive enough.</p> <p><i>It's a crisis of fathering.</i> Boys with less-involved fathers are more likely to drop out of school, drink, do drugs, become delinquent, and end up in prison.</p> <p><i>It's a crisis of purpose.</i> Boys' old senses of purposes, being a warrior, a leader, or a sole breadwinner, are fading. Many bright boys are experiencing a \"purpose void\", feeling alienated, withdrawn, and addicted to immediate gratification. Compounding this issue are addicting video games that lead to distraction and ADHD.</p> <p>So, what is<i> The Boy Crisis</i>? A comprehensive blueprint for what parents, teachers, and policy-makers can do to renew our sons' sense of purpose to help them become men, fathers, and leaders worthy of our respect.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
