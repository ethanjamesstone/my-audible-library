window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Twenty to 30 million Americans suffer from some form of diagnosable depression, and their ranks are growing. Psychologist Michael D. Yapko explains that in order to find relief, more than the current episode of depression must be examined. In <i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</i>, he presents skills that enable listeners to understand and ultimately avert depression's recurring cycles.</p> <p><i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</i> begins by translating the clinical literature on psychotherapy and antidepressant medication into language that can be used to enhance an understanding of depression, and to personalize individual cures. Yapko uses a conversational, anecdotal tone that encourages listeners to take an active approach to helping themselves. Special sections entitled \"Learn by Doing\" and \"Shifting Perspectives\" help develop the skills necessary to manage difficult experiences.</p> <p>More realistic and helpful than other depression-management books on the market, <i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</i> defines what causes depression and, best of all, clarifies what can be done about it. With this knowledge in hand, listeners can control their depression, rather than having depression control them.</p>";
