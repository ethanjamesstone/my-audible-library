window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Discover the vital relationship that will take your company from \"what's next?\" to \"we have liftoff!\" Visionaries have groundbreaking ideas. Integrators make those ideas realities. This explosive combination is the key to getting everything you want out of your business. It worked for Disney. It worked for McDonald's. It worked for Ford. It can work for you. From the author of the best-selling <i>Traction</i>, <i>Rocket Fuel</i> details the integral roles of the visionary and integrator and explains how an effective relationship between the two can help your business thrive. Offering advice to help visionary-minded and integrator-minded individuals find one another, <i>Rocket Fuel</i> also features assessments, so you're able to determine whether you're a visionary or an integrator. Without an integrator, a visionary is far less likely to succeed long term and realize the company's ultimate goals; likewise, with no visionary, an integrator can't rise to his or her full potential. When these two people come together to share their natural talents and innate skill sets, it's like rocket fuel - they have the power to reach new heights for virtually any company or organization. </p>";
