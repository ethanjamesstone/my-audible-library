window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“One of the finest, most compelling accounts of what happened to corporate America and Wall Street in the 1980s.” (</b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>A number-one <i>New York Times </i>best seller and arguably the best business narrative ever written, <i>Barbarians at the Gate </i>is the classic account of the fall of RJR Nabisco. An enduring masterpiece of investigative journalism by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, it includes a new afterword by the authors that brings this remarkable story of greed and double-dealings up to date 20 years after the famed deal. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> calls <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i>, “Superlative”. The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> raves, “It’s hard to imagine a better story...and it’s hard to imagine a better account.” And in an era of spectacular business crashes and federal bailouts, it still stands as a valuable cautionary tale that must be heeded.</p>";
