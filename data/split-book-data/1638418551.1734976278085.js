window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p> </p> <p>Written by Neil Rackham, former president and founder of Huthwaite corporation, <i>SPIN Selling</i> is a must-listen for anyone involved in selling or managing a sales force. Unquestionably the best-documented account of sales success ever collected and the result of the Huthwaite corporation's massive 12-year, one-million-dollar research into effective sales performance, this groundbreaking resource details the revolutionary SPIN (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-payoff) strategy.</p> <p>In <i>SPIN Selling</i>, Rackham delivers the first book to specifically examine selling high-value product and services. By following the simple, practical, and easy-to-apply techniques of SPIN, listeners will be able to dramatically increase their sales volume from major accounts. Rackham answers key questions such as “What makes success in major sales?” and “Why do techniques like closing work in small sales but fail in larger ones?”</p> <p>You will learn why traditional sales methods that were developed for small consumer sales just won't work for large sales and why conventional selling methods are doomed to fail in major sales. Packed with real-world examples and informative case studies - and backed by hard research data - <i>SPIN Selling</i> is the million-dollar key to understanding and producing record-breaking high-end sales performance.</p>";
