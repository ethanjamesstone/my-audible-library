window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“A wise and fresh approach to mindful parenting.” (Tara Brach, author of </b><b><i>Radical Acceptance</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>A kinder, more compassionate world starts with kind and compassionate kids. In <i>Raising Good Humans</i>, you’ll find powerful and practical strategies to break free from “reactive parenting” habits and raise kind, cooperative, and confident kids.</p> <p>Whether you’re running late for school, trying to get your child to eat their vegetables, or dealing with an epic meltdown in the checkout line at a grocery store - being a parent is hard work! And, as parents, many of us react in times of stress without thinking - often by yelling. But what if, instead of always reacting on autopilot, you could respond thoughtfully in those moments, keep your cool, and get from A to B on time and in one piece?</p> <p>With this book, you’ll find powerful mindfulness skills for calming your own stress response when difficult emotions arise. You’ll also discover strategies for cultivating respectful communication, effective conflict resolution, and reflective listening. In the process, you’ll learn to examine your own unhelpful patterns and ingrained reactions that reflect the generational habits shaped by <i>your </i>parents, so you can break the cycle and respond to your children in more skillful ways.</p> <p>When children experience a parent reacting with kindness and patience, <i>they</i> learn to act with kindness as well - thereby altering generational patterns for a kinder, more compassionate future. With this essential guide, you’ll see how changing your own “autopilot reactions” can create a lasting positive impact, not just for <i>your </i>kids, but for generations to come.</p> <p>An essential, must-listen for all parents - now more than ever.</p> <p><b>“To raise the children we hope to raise, we have to learn to become the person we hoped to be…. This wonderful book will help you handle the ride.” (KJ Dell’Antonia, author of </b><b><i>How to Be a Happier Parent</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Hunter Clarke-Fields shares her wisdom and personal experience to help parents create peaceful families.” (Joanna Faber and Julie King, coauthors of </b><b><i>How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
