window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling investing \"bible\" offers new information, new insights, and new perspectives </p> <p><i>The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</i> is the classic guide to getting smart about the market. Legendary mutual fund pioneer John C. Bogle reveals his key to getting more out of investing: low-cost index funds. Bogle describes the simplest and most effective investment strategy for building wealth over the long term: buy and hold, at very low cost, a mutual fund that tracks a broad stock market Index such as the S&amp;P 500. </p> <p>While the stock market has tumbled and then soared since the first edition of <i>The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</i> was published in April 2007, Bogle's investment principles have endured and served investors well. This tenth anniversary edition includes updated data and new information but maintains the same long-term perspective as in its predecessor. Bogle has also added two new chapters designed to provide further guidance to investors: one on asset allocation, the other on retirement investing. </p> <p>A portfolio focused on index funds is the only investment that effectively guarantees your fair share of stock market returns. This strategy is favored by Warren Buffett, who said this about Bogle: \"For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.... Today, however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.\" </p> <p>Bogle shows you how to make index investing work for you and help you achieve your financial goals and finds support from some of the world's best financial minds: not only Warren Buffett but Benjamin Graham, Paul Samuelson, Burton Malkiel, Yale's David Swensen, Cliff Asness of AQR, and many others. </p> <p>This new edition of <i>The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</i> offers you the same solid strategy as its predecessor for building your financial future. </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Build a broadly diversified, low-cost portfolio without the risks of individual stocks, manager selection, or sector rotation. </li> <li>Forget the fads and marketing hype, and focus on what works in the real world. </li> <li>Understand that stock returns are generated by three sources (dividend yield, earnings growth, and change in market valuation) in order to establish rational expectations for stock returns over the coming decade. </li> <li>Recognize that in the long run, business reality trumps market expectations. </li> <li>Learn how to harness the magic of compounding returns while avoiding the tyranny of compounding costs. </li> </ul> <p>While index investing allows you to sit back and let the market do the work for you, too many investors trade frantically, turning a winner's game into a loser's game. <i>The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</i> is a solid guidebook to your financial future.</p>";
