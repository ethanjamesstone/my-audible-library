window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For most of his life, Dr. Glover, the author of the groundbreaking <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i>, was what he calls a \"bad dater.\" He assumed the women he wanted were not interested in him. He believed that women disliked sex and thought men who wanted sex were bad. When he did get a girlfriend by practicing what he calls \"Nice Guy Seduction,\" he typically hung on way too long for fear of having to enter the dating world all over again. But this all changed when he got divorced in his mid-forties. Dr. Glover decided to approach dating as if it were a scientific experiment. To his surprise, he quickly found that talking with women, getting numbers, and getting laid was nowhere as difficult as he had thought. He often wondered what planet he had landed on.</p> <p><i>Dating Essentials for Men</i> was born of this experiment. Dr. Glover has since taught thousands of men how to interact confidently with women and find the love and sex they have been seeking.</p> <p>Are you ready to let go of the games, the tricks, the seduction, the pickup, the negs, the cocky-funny routines, the buying women drinks, the volunteering to help their sister move? Do you want to learn how to create the kind of authentic attraction that naturally brings women to you? If so, <i>Dating Essentials for Men</i> is the only dating guide you will ever need. </p>";
