window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dr. Joseph Murphy expands on his theory that the latent powers inherent in our subconscious can improve our lives. </p> <p>Each of us possesses two minds: the objective mind and the subjective mind. Murphy discusses ways to integrate the two. He also explains how to harness the power of the mind, especially the subconscious. He gives specific steps to nourish your conscious mind with the tools and attitudes that will open up the infinite power of your subconscious mind. </p> <p>Whether you wish to conquer a bad habit, be more successful, obtain harmony in your family, or achieve goals that have thus far been unattainable, Murphy offers guidelines to put you on the right path. </p> <p>As the founder of the Church of Divine Science, Dr. Murphy produced books, tapes, and radio broadcasts on spiritual matters, the historical values of life, the art of wholesome living, and the teachings of great philosophers from both Eastern and Western cultures. </p>";
