window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>People from different walks of life all want the same thing: success. Some are lucky enough to be at a position where they can easily realize their goals in life. Others, though, are not so fortunate. For most people, achieving success means making a lot of sacrifices. Sometimes these sacrifices pay off, and one's goals are met. In other times, however, success slips past, regardless if one has paid his dues, so to speak. What these point to is this: you need more than just the usual elements for success - an education, hard work, patience, motivation, etc. - in order to get what you want. But what else do you need to do to increase your chance at leading a successful life? The answer is to take advantage of the power of your subconscious mind. </p>";
