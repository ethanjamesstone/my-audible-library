window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Master the science of funnel building to grow your company online with sales funnels in this updated edition from the $100 million entrepreneur and cofounder of the software company ClickFunnels. </p> <p><i>DotCom Secrets </i>is not just another \"how-to\" audiobook on internet marketing. This audio is not about getting more traffic to your website - yet these secrets will help you get exponentially more traffic than ever before. </p> <p>This audio is not about increasing your conversions - yet these secrets will increase your conversions more than any headline tweak or split test you could ever hope to make. </p> <p>Low traffic or low conversion rates are symptoms of a much greater problem that's a little harder to see (that's the bad news), but a lot easier to fix (that's the good news). </p> <p>What most businesses really have is a \"funnel\" problem. Your funnel is the online process that you take your potential customers through to turn them into actual customers. Everyone has a funnel (even if they don't realize it), and yours is either bringing more customers to you or repelling them. </p> <p>Over the past decade, we have run tens of thousands of split tests to figure out which funnels work for almost every situation you can dream of. If your goal is to generate leads, we have funnel frameworks and scripts for that. If you want to sell a product or a service, there are frameworks and scripts for that as well. </p> <p>The sales funnel frameworks that you will find on this audio have now helped literally tens of thousands of companies around the world to grow faster than ever before. This audiobook will give you access to all the processes, funnels, frameworks, and scripts that we use to scale our companies online so you can fix your funnel and turn it into the most profitable member of your team! </p> <p>This audio product contains a PDF with supporting material, and the PDF is available to download. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
