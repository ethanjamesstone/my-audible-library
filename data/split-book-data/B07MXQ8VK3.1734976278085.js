window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What does it mean to be a man in the modern world? Throughout history, being a man has meant different things. Maybe being a man was about being a good hunter, or a good soldier, a good businessman, or maybe good with women. <i>Hard Times Create Strong Men</i> examines what it means to be a man in the modern world relative to money, sex, religion, and politics. This audiobook examines what worked and what doesn’t work based on proven history instead of feelings. This audiobook is raw, real, and politically incorrect. It will threaten and challenge your ideas of what it means to be a man and how to better serve your purpose. As the cycles of history prove over and over again, hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times”.</p>";
