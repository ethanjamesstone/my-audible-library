window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Has your life been conscripted by an economic religion?</p> <p>Learn how to free yourself and your life through the power of unscripted entrepreneurship.</p> <p>Grab your front-row seat in the story of a lifetime. Witness how one family escapes the rat race - the world's economic religion - and how you can too.</p> <p>By all appearances, Jeff and Samantha Trotman are living the American dream. But behind the white picket fence, they endure an American nightmare. With little time for each other, a pile of debt, and Ferrari taste on a Ford budget, the ruse of affluence is killing them. Two respectable jobs and a lovely suburban house paint a pretty picture, but behind the ink is a broken marriage rife with meaningless work and dead dreams. And now, with an unplanned pregnancy, they’re facing a mid-life crisis 20 years early.</p> <p>With little time and looming bankruptcy, the Trotmans are forced to face the red-pill truth they long denied: They were living, but they weren’t alive. Determined to resurrect their life and their marriage, the Trotmans plot a rat-race escape - only to find themselves more thickly in it. As tensions rise and hope fades, follow along step-by-step as the Trotmans pivot to a new strategy and a new career: starting a business as entrepreneurs. While they navigate their journey, you’ll learn 120 wealth-building strategies and principles that your mainstream financial guru won’t dare reveal - actionable concepts that will help you profit your way into the unscripted one percent, an emerging economic class of entrepreneurs who enjoy a lifetime of freedom emancipated from miserly living and Wall Street's \"save, pray, and wait\" paradigm. </p> <p>Discover how one family escapes the wage-slaving grind and wins a lifetime of financial freedom, leaving behind the tyranny of meaningless jobs and mediocre living - and how you can do the same. Not in 50 years, but five or 10.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
