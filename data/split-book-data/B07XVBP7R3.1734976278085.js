How many email subscribers?</p> <p>But as entrepreneurs, we have to remember that there are people behind all that data. People who are looking to us to be a leader, to give advice, and to care. In this dog-eat-dog world, these are the people who are looking for someone who they can trust and who they know have their best interests in mind.</p> <p>These are the people, if you connect with them in the right way, who will become superfans. Followers may \"like\" an Instagram post. Customers may buy a product. But superfans will be your biggest supporters. They will promote you and your products because they know you have made a difference in their lives. They will tell their friends. They will send you encouraging emails.</p> <p>Whether you're a shy YouTuber just starting out or the leader of a Fortune 500 company, your superfans are out there waiting for you to connect with them.</p> <p>You don't need to change the entire world to build a successful business; you just need to change someone's world. People don't become superfans the moment they find you. They become superfans because of the magical moments you create for them over time.</p>";
