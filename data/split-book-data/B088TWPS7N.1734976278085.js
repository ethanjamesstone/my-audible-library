window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Felix Dennis is an expert at proving people wrong. Starting as a college dropout with no family money, he created a publishing empire, founded <i>Maxim</i> magazine, made himself one of the richest people in the UK, and had a blast in the process. </p> <p><i>How to Get Rich</i> is different from any other book on the subject because Dennis isn't selling snake oil, investment tips, or motivational claptrap. He merely wants to help people embrace entrepreneurship and to share lessons he learned the hard way. He reveals, for example, why a regular paycheck is like crack cocaine; why great ideas are vastly overrated; and why \"ownership isn't the important thing, it's the only thing\".</p>";
